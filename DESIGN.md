# Design

## Client/Server stack

- Node.js & NPM: The basics
- Express: HTTP handling
- SSDP: Discovery of (Wiim) MediaRenderer devices on the network
- UPNP client: Talk to MediaRenderer devices on the network
- Socket.IO: Realtime connection between server and client
- Gulp?: Build tools
- Vue.js?: Client framework for presentation (or should I go with Angular?)
